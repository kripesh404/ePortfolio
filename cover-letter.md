Dear [Gosia],

I am writing to express my interest in the Senior Developer position within the Engineering Department at Auto & General. With over nine years of experience in the ICT field, including my current role within our organization, I am eager to take the next step in my career and contribute at a more senior level.

Since joining Auto & General, I have built a solid foundation in backend development, system integration, and AI-driven automation. Most recently, I led the design and development of an AI-human assistance system using Synthflow, Node.js, and Supabase, which automated customer call handling and quote generation in University's Capstone Project. This solution significantly improved customer response times, enhanced satisfaction, and reduced operational costs.

My work has consistently required cross-functional collaboration, agile delivery, and creative problem-solving—skills I have refined through projects involving OpenAI integration, webhook orchestration, and rigorous testing protocols. I’m particularly proud of how I balanced a hybrid agile-waterfall project model to deliver outcomes effectively while ensuring thorough QA and user acceptance.

I am passionate about leveraging emerging technologies to solve real business challenges and am excited by the prospect of mentoring junior developers and contributing to strategic technical initiatives within our team. My proactive communication style, technical leadership, and dedication to continuous improvement make me a strong candidate for this role.

Thank you for considering my application. I would welcome the opportunity to further discuss how I can add value to the Engineering Department in this new capacity.

Sincerely,
Kripesh Bista
